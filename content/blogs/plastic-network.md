# Evolution
The though process behind this experiment was based on the thought that natural selection and evolution is what lead to human general intelligence. Competetion for survival, mutatations, reproduction, carrying capacities, instincts, and adaptability are all facets of what makes humans so smart. Based on this idea, I broke the network down into two parts, a plastic brain <b>W<sub>plastic</sub></b>, and its reward network, <b>W<sub>instict</sub></b>. The reward network, or the instincts of the brain are trained over generations using a variety of different approaches and environments, and the plastic brain which is trained over a single agent lifetime. This way, there exists both <b>"Generational"</b> and <b>"Lifetime"</b> learning experiences. My theory is that this type of training over generations and paired enviornments which simulate natural evolution of intelligence, the reward network will be able to "learn how to learn" instead of capturing task specific underlying patterns, and generates reasoning for the plastic layer to produce an action, and the plastic layer, through action, generates a shift in the reward network, it is the potentiator of deciding which old neurons need to change to adapt to the situation it in based on its instincts. 

Take this for an example, imagine a migratory bird thats specialized for its niche. Every winter it must migrate to a warmer part of the world. Technically the bird does not know where its supposed to go, it just follows instincts developed over millions of years of evolution. Over its lifetime, the bird keeps going to the same spot over and ove again because its just following generational instincts and its working. One day though, it arrives to its migratory spot just to see that its been erradicated due to wild fire. This is where the plastic brain comes in, as the bird now realizes it cant go back to the same spot next season, but instinctually it looks for another migratory spot nearby. Its not that looking for that one generational spot was hard encoded into the bird, its more so that it was able to instinctual determine that migratory spot = warm place with low competition. Now lets say in 10 years, the forest fire has produced a more abundant area for the bird than ever, but because the bird had to change its migratory pattern, its passed this down through generations and only visits the new spot, at some point, due to random mutation either in the plastic layer or the instinct layer, a descendent decides to go back to the old island following old instincts and finds that its more prosperous than the last. This is a real life example of "hopping out of a local minima" produced by abundance. 

In algorithm form, the plastic layer has multiple variables that control
