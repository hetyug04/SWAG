  This report details the implementation and findings of the "Propaganda Tracker" dashboard (Project 3). We analyzed over 160,000 posts from Reddit, Bluesky, and 4chan to investigate the relationship between propaganda techniques and toxicity, specifically for the Israel Palestince conflict. By utilizing our custom data collection and analysis pipeline, and external services like the Google perspective API, we found that (1) geopolitical events trigger significant toxicity spikes $(p<0,001)$, (2) Bluesky exhibits the strongest propaganda-toxicity correlation $(r=0.252)$ and (3) dehumanization is the strongest predictor of toxicity (+14.9% per occurrence). The final system includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.
